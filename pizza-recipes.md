Experience a Michelin-quality Margherita Pizza that celebrates the essence of simplicity and exceptional ingredients. This recipe brings together the finest flavors, perfectly balanced to create a truly remarkable pizza.

## Ingredients

- 1 ball of Neapolitan-style pizza dough
- 1/2 cup San Marzano tomato sauce
- 8 ounces of buffalo mozzarella cheese (water-packed), torn into small pieces
- Handful of fresh basil leaves (Genovese or sweet basil)
- High-quality extra-virgin olive oil (cold-pressed)
- Sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat a pizza stone in the oven at the highest temperature possible (around 500¬∞F/260¬∞C) for at least 30 minutes.

2. On a lightly floured surface, stretch the pizza dough into a round shape, keeping the center slightly thicker than the edges. Take care not to overwork the dough to maintain a light and airy crust.

3. Place the stretched dough onto a pizza peel or a floured surface covered with parchment paper.

4. Spoon the San Marzano tomato sauce onto the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Use the back of the spoon to spread the sauce evenly.

5. Distribute the torn buffalo mozzarella pieces over the sauce, ensuring an even coverage across the pizza.

6. Tear the fresh basil leaves and scatter them on top of the cheese.

7. Drizzle a generous amount of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza to enhance the flavors.

8. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper over the top, adding a touch of seasoning.

9. Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven and bake for approximately 90 seconds to 2 minutes, or until the crust is beautifully charred and blistered.

10. Remove the pizza from the oven using a pizza peel or spatula, and let it rest for a minute to allow the flavors to meld.

11. Slice the Margherita Pizza and enjoy!
