# First Invention of Pizza.

## Pizza was first invented in Naples, Italy.

Focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius to which toppings were then added, was a precursor of pizza.

In Ancient Greece, citizens made a flatbread called plakous, which was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, cheese and garlic.

Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
